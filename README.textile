K's dot files for Max OS modified from Todd Werthâ€™s dotfiles.

I store all my command-line files in a folder (cl), then under that folder there are 3 sub-folders (cl/bin cl/etc cl/doc), to keep them organized away from all my other files.  I link (etc/link) the dot files to the root of my home folder, so I prefer to store them without the . (gitignore rather than .gitignore), then I add the dot in the link.  So if you use one, make sure you put the dot back.
